// One interface, two implementations. `local` runs the steps as subprocesses
// with resource limits and timeouts -- enough to stop a runaway candidate,
// not a security boundary. `docker` runs the same steps in throwaway

// knows only this interface, so a backend swap does not touch scheduling,
// reporting or the fleet protocol.
