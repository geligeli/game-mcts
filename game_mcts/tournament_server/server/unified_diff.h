// Reading and writing unified diffs, on the coordinator.
//
// A submission is a patch, and the coordinator has to know three things about
// one before it stores it: which paths it touches (to check against the
// problem's policy), how big it is (to bound it), and what a newly added file
// contains (so the leaderboard can show source without a checkout).
//
// Deliberately a header parser, not a patch applier. The coordinator never
// applies anything -- that is the worker's job, in a container, with real git.
// Parsing here answers "may this be stored and dispatched"; a patch that parses
// but does not apply comes back as an ordinary order error, which is the right
// place for it because only the worker has the tree to apply it to.
//
// Being lenient about hunk bodies is intentional for the same reason: this is a
// gate on paths and size, and pretending to validate diff semantics the applier
// will re-check anyway would just be a second, worse implementation of git.
