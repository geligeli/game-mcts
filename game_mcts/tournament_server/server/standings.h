// How a problem's submissions are scored and ordered.
//
// Two problems ask genuinely different questions -- "who beats whom" and "how
// fast is it" -- and only one of them has an opponent. Rather than teach the
// scheduler, the Arena service and the leaderboard about both, they all go
// through this: record an order's result, ask for the standings, render what
// comes back.
//
// The coordinator is the only thing that writes standings. A match's referee
// keeps its own ratings while it plays, but they die with the container: they
// exist so a game has somewhere to record itself, not to be authoritative. What
// crosses the wire is a tally, and this turns the tally into a rating here,
// once, on the machine that owns the store.
