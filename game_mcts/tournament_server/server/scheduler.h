// Turns "evaluate this candidate" into work for the sandbox fleet.
//
// A job names a candidate and an opponent spec; the spec expands into one or
// more orders, and an order is the unit of dispatch. **One order is one whole
// evaluation**: it carries both sides of a match, so a worker builds the
// candidate, builds its opponent (or names a builtin), referees the games and
// reports a tally, without any other worker cooperating.
//
// It used to take two mirrored orders that had to be dispatched together,
// because half a match was a built bot parked at a central broker's rendezvous
// burning a slot for no game. Moving the referee into the sandbox removed the
// pairing, and with it the batch, the all-or-nothing dispatch and the
// bookkeeping that told a job which half of a pair was its own.
//
// The scheduler owns no threads. Everything happens on the caller's thread
// under one mutex: enqueueing from an Arena RPC, and dispatching when a worker
// attaches, finishes an order, or drops.
