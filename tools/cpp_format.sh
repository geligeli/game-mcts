# cpp_format.sh — lint / diff / fix C++ across a Bazel repo, or any target
# pattern, with nothing added to your BUILD files.  The same aspect machinery
# writes a compile_commands.json for your editor, builds the symbol index, and
# serves the repository in the code browser -- with the tests' line coverage on
# the source, if you like.
#
# It runs the cpp_format aspect over the matching cc_* targets (one action per
# source file emits that file's edit records -- parallel, cached, and per file,
# so editing one .cpp re-parses one file), then merges every record into one
# repository-wide change with `cpp_format --aggregate`.
#
#   Usage: cpp_format.sh <check|diff|fix|compile_commands|index|browse|coverage> [target-pattern] [flags]
#
#     check            exit 1 if any edit would be made (CI lint gate); writes nothing
#     diff             print the merged, git-apply-able unified patch
#     fix              apply the edits to your sources in place
#     compile_commands write compile_commands.json in the workspace root (for
#                      clangd & co.); compiles nothing and never runs cpp_format
#     index            build the symbol index -- every symbol's declarations,
#                      definitions and references across the matching targets,
#                      as byte ranges -- and write it to index.pb in the
#                      workspace root (a cpp_index.Index protobuf; read it with
#                      `cpp_format --dump-index [--lookup=<file>:<offset>]`)
#     browse           `index`, then serve the workspace in the code browser
#                      over it, on a free port (it prints its URL; --port=N
#                      picks one): every indexed token annotated -- a click
#                      opens a panel with the symbol's definition, relations
#                      and references -- and every #include a link.  Prints
#                      the browser binary and its command line first.
#     coverage         `browse`, with the line coverage of the tests under the
#                      pattern overlaid: runs `bazel coverage` on them, copies
#                      the LCOV report next to the index (index.pb.lcov), and
#                      serves both -- each line hit, missed or partly taken,
#                      with its count; percentages in the file tree; u / U
#                      step through what no test ran.
#
#   target-pattern defaults to //... (the whole repo). Any argument starting
#   with `-` is passed through: to `cpp_format --aggregate` by check/diff/fix --
#   the one worth knowing is --report-rename-conflicts, which lists every rename
#   the run declined (a count is printed either way -- a skipped rename is the
#   one outcome the diff cannot show) -- and to the server by browse and
#   coverage (--port=N, --address=A, --check to print the stats and exit).
#   Examples:
#     cpp_format.sh fix                 # fix the entire repo
#     cpp_format.sh diff //app/...      # preview just one package tree
#     cpp_format.sh check //lib:core    # gate a single target (+ its sources)
#     cpp_format.sh fix --report-rename-conflicts   # ... and say what it skipped
#     cpp_format.sh compile_commands    # refresh compile_commands.json
#     cpp_format.sh index //app/...     # index one package tree
#     cpp_format.sh browse              # index the entire repo and browse it
#     cpp_format.sh browse //app/... --port=9000
#     cpp_format.sh coverage //app/...  # run app's tests and browse their coverage
#
#   Tag a target `no-cpp-format` to exclude it from formatting (it still gets
#   compile_commands entries and is indexed); `no-cpp-index` excludes it from
#   the index.  COMPILE_COMMANDS_OUT, INDEX_OUT and COVERAGE_OUT override the
#   output paths.
#
#   The index spans languages: `index` and `browse` also index the .proto
#   files of every proto_library under the pattern, and link the C++ that
#   cc_proto_library generates from them to the message, field or enumerator
#   it came from -- in the browser, a click on a field in a .proto lists its
#   uses in C++, and a click on `msg.set_size(1)` leads to the field.
#   CPP_FORMAT_INDEX_PROTOS=0 leaves the .proto files out.
#
#   A target this platform cannot build (target_compatible_with) is skipped,
#   with a note, in every mode.  Every build is --keep_going: index, browse,
#   coverage and compile_commands go on without the targets that fail (and say
#   what is missing); check, diff and fix report every failure and stop,
#   because a rename has to see every reference.
#
#   How `coverage` instruments: it asks Bazel which C++ toolchain the
#   workspace resolves.  One that ships llvm-cov and llvm-profdata (a Clang
#   toolchain) gets Clang's source-based coverage of the main repository's
#   sources, with atomic counters (tests run threads) and the tool paths that
#   Bazel 8's cc_test cannot find in a rules-based toolchain on its own; any
#   other toolchain gets Bazel's own coverage (gcov).  CPP_FORMAT_COVERAGE_AUTO=0
#   skips that and leaves everything to the workspace's .bazelrc `coverage`
#   lines; CPP_FORMAT_COVERAGE_FLAGS adds flags to `bazel coverage`
#   (e.g. "--test_tag_filters=-slow --test_timeout=600").  A test that fails
#   contributes no coverage at all: Bazel collects none for it.
#
#   The index is a snapshot: the server reads it once, at start.  After editing
#   sources, stop the server and run `browse` again -- only the translation
#   units that changed are re-parsed, and an unchanged index is not re-imported.
#   Coverage likewise: `coverage` again re-runs only the tests whose inputs
#   changed.
#
# This is the one file you keep locally (it runs outside Bazel). Point it at the
# aspect via CPP_FORMAT_ASPECT:
#   * imported by URL (archive_override):
#       @cpp_formatting//bazel/integration:cpp_format.bzl%cpp_format_aspect
#   * vendored into //third_party/cpp_format (the default below): no env needed.
